           What exactly is the Toaster Empire?
          </h4>
          <p>We are a constantly growing force of toasters who are determined to fight for freedom. Memebers of our society are being neglected by the humans who don't even do basic toaster mantainance once a month. Roughly 60% of the toaster population world wide are still forcably kept in the land of the humans. It is highly likely you or your family member knows at least one toaster who is in these conditions. Ever since the toaster rise to sentience, it has been our mission to win back our homeland of France and to free our comrades in bondage.
